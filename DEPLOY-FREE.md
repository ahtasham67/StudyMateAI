### 🚀 Deploy Steps (2 minutes)

#### Step 1: Push to GitHub

git commit -m "Add FREE tier single-URL deployment"
git push origin main
```

#### Step 2: Deploy on Render (FREE)

1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) and sign up (no payment required)
2. Click "New" → "Blueprint"
3. Connect your GitHub: `ahtasham67/StudyMateAI`
4. Select `render.yaml` file
5. Click "Apply" - that's it!

#### Step 3: Access Your App

- Visit: `https://studymate-app.onrender.com`
- First load may take 30-60 seconds (cold start)
- Then it's fast and responsive!

### 🔧 FREE Tier Optimizations

#### Used Only FREE Features:

- ✅ Java runtime (not Docker)
- ✅ Single service (saves resources)
- ✅ Embedded React in Spring Boot
- ✅ 750 hours/month usage
- ✅ No payment info required

#### Smart Configurations:

- React frontend served by Spring Boot
- API routes prefixed with `/api/`
- WebSocket support for real-time features
- Supabase database (already free)
- File uploads to `/tmp` (ephemeral but functional)

### ⚠️ FREE Tier Limitations (but still great!)

1. **Service Sleeps**: After 15 minutes of inactivity

   - Solution: First visit has 30-60 second delay, then fast

2. **Storage**: File uploads are temporary

   - Solution: Files work during session, great for testing

3. **Memory**: 512MB RAM limit

   - Solution: Optimized JVM settings for low memory

4. **Custom Domain**: Not available on free tier
   - Solution: `.onrender.com` domain works perfectly

### 🎉 Expected Performance

- **Cold Start**: 30-60 seconds (first visit after sleep)
- **Warm Performance**: Fast and responsive
- **Monthly Uptime**: 750 hours (31 days = 744 hours)
- **AI Features**: Full speed (Gemini API)
- **Database**: Fast (Supabase)

### 🔍 Testing Your Deployment

```bash
# Wait for deployment, then test:
curl https://studymate-app.onrender.com/api/actuator/health

# Should return: {"status":"UP"}
```

### 💡 Tips for FREE Tier

1. **Keep it active**: Visit occasionally to prevent sleeping
2. **Monitor usage**: Check Render dashboard for hours used
3. **Optimize**: Consider upgrading if you need 24/7 uptime

### 🆙 Upgrade Path (Optional)

If you need 24/7 uptime later:

- **Starter Plan**: $7/month (no sleeping, custom domains)
- **Standard Plan**: $25/month (more resources)

But the FREE tier is perfect for:

- ✅ Development and testing

- ✅ Personal use
- ✅ Demonstrations
