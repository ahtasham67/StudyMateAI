# JavaScript Programming Fundamentals

## Chapter 1: Introduction to JavaScript
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that enables interactive web pages.

### Key Features:
- Dynamic typing
- First-class functions  
- Prototype-based object orientation
- Event-driven programming

## Chapter 2: Variables and Data Types
JavaScript has several data types:
1. **Number** - for integers and floating-point numbers
2. **String** - for text data
3. **Boolean** - for true/false values
4. **Object** - for complex data structures

### Variable Declaration:
- `var`: function-scoped, can be redeclared
- `let`: block-scoped, cannot be redeclared  
- `const`: block-scoped, immutable reference

## Chapter 3: Functions
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.

```javascript
function functionName(parameters) {
    // code to execute
    return value;
}
```

## Chapter 4: Control Structures
### Conditional Statements:
- if/else statements
- switch statements
- ternary operator

### Loops:
- for loops
- while loops
- do-while loops

## Chapter 5: Objects and Arrays
Objects are collections of key-value pairs:
```javascript
const person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    city: "New York"
};
```
